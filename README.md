# HR_ANALYTICS

This project is a copy project which invoolves data transformation and analysis exercise focusing on employee attendance using Excel, Power BI, and DAX.The dataset is from Atliq, the HR provided these dataset to her Data Analyst to get various insights.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to transform and analyze employee attendance data from real-life office attendance records. To ensure privacy, the original dataset's employee names were replaced with random names, preserving the structure while safeguarding personal information.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of three sheets—April, May, and June 2022—containing the following columns:

- `Employee Code`: Unique identifier for each employee
- `Employee Name`: Randomly assigned names for privacy
- `Employee Attendance Record for all data `: Records whether the employee was present at the office, working from home, on sick leave, etc.

## Tools Used

- **Excel:** Used for the original data collection and structuring
- **Power BI:** Employed for data transformation and visualization
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilized for calculating attendance percentages

## Transformations

Using Power BI, the data was transformed and visualized to derive the following metrics:
- **Present Percentage:** Percentage of time employees were present at the office
- **Sick Leave Percentage:** Percentage of time employees took sick leave
- **Work from Home Percentage:** Percentage of time employees worked remotely

## Files Included

- **Excel Sheets:** April, May, and June containing the anonymized employee attendance data
- **Power BI File:** Contains the data transformation and visualization process
- **Readme File:** Explains the project and its components

## Instructions

1. **Data Source:** Replace the provided anonymized data with your own dataset, maintaining a similar structure.
2. **Power BI:** Load your data into Power BI, adjust queries, and update DAX calculations as needed.
3. **Visualizations:** Customize visualizations to suit your analysis requirements.
4. **GitHub Repository:** Fork or clone this repository to explore the project and adapt it to your needs.
